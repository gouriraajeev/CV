    <ul>
        <li>Fake News Detection System</li>
        <p>This project aims to detect fake news based on the analysis of news headlines. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and reinforcement learning, the system evaluates the credibility of a given headline and displays both a real score and a fake score. The model is designed to continuously improve its accuracy through feedback-based learning. Future enhancements include integrating blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent data validation.</p>
        <li>Textual Video-to-Speech Interface for the Visually Impaired</li>
        <p>The objective of this project is to create an accessible interface that helps visually impaired users access textual information from videos. The system captures a sequence of low-resolution video frames, detects and rectifies text regions, and converts them into high-resolution blocks suitable for OCR processing. The extracted text is then transformed into speech using TTS technology. The project addresses challenges such as feature detection, mosaicing, binarization, and system integration, resulting in a robust and user-friendly assistive tool.</p>
